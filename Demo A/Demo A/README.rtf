\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Demo A
\b0 \
\

\b Explanation:
\b0   This is a demonstration of using the GPU interactively, calling for calculations (via a draw call) \
after a successful download of a payload that could be parsed for example, and scanning it for a signature.  \
A use case would be downloading a binary resource such as a PDF or image.\
\

\b How to run:
\b0  This can be run in the simulator on the actual device.  Performance numbers in the report are based\
on device testing.\
\
The application will download various payloads from an external website and after each will scan for signatures.\
Some payloads have no signatures of interest while others do.  A successful run of the application will show that\
after multiple deliveries the GPU has successfully found the 1/3 payloads with a signature of interest.  \
\

\b Of Note: 
\b0 The application repeats the cycle of downloads to investigate the performance and battery effect of GPU \
calls on the application.  This application does require internet access\
