# After running the demo, which is a simple matrix calculation (two diagonal 256x256 matrices)
# then we can verify the results, which should be another 'greeen' matrix, along diagonal

# run the python script to count 'green' occurances
python count_occurances.py results.txt 0x00ff00ff

# Output you should see...
Searching <results.txt> for occurances of <0x00ff00ff>
There were 512 occurnances of <0x00ff00ff>
